# Reddit User Persona Generator

This script generates a user persona based on a Reddit user's recent posts and comments. It fetches content from Reddit, uses the OpenRouter API to analyze the text and generate a detailed persona, and then saves the persona to a text file.

## Features

  - Fetches a user's latest posts and comments from Reddit.
  - Utilizes OpenRouter with a specified model to generate a structured user persona.
  - Samples a random subset of the user's content for analysis.
  - Saves the generated persona to a local text file named `{username}_persona.txt`.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  - [Python 3.6 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Python's package installer)

You will also need API credentials for:

  - **Reddit API**: To fetch user data.
  - **OpenRouter API**: To generate the persona.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your environment and run the application.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine or download and unzip the source code.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2\. Create a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

**On macOS and Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file. If a `requirements.txt` file is not available, you can install the packages directly.

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
requests
praw
python-dotenv
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4\. Configure Environment Variables

This script uses a `.env` file to manage API keys and other configuration variables.

1.  Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project directory.
2.  Add the following lines to the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual API credentials.

<!-- end list -->

```env
# Reddit API Credentials
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_REDDIT_CLIENT_ID"
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET"
USER_AGENT="YOUR_APP_NAME_BY_YOUR_REDDIT_USERNAME"

# OpenRouter API Credentials
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
OPENROUTER_MODEL="anthropic/claude-3-haiku" # Or any other model you prefer
OPENROUTER_ENDPOINT="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
```

#### How to get your credentials:

  * **Reddit API**:

    1.  Go to the [Reddit App Preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps).
    2.  Click "are you a developer? create an app...".
    3.  Fill out the form:
          * **name**: A unique name for your application.
          * **type**: Select "script".
          * **redirect uri**: You can use `http://localhost:8080`.
    4.  Click "create app". Your `client_id` (under your app name) and `client_secret` will be displayed.
    5.  For the `USER_AGENT`, a good practice is a descriptive string, like `MyAppName v1.0 by /u/YourUsername`.

  * **OpenRouter API**:

    1.  Sign in to your [OpenRouter.ai account](https://openrouter.ai/).
    2.  Navigate to your account settings or keys page.
    3.  Generate a new API key.

## üöÄ How to Execute the Script

Once you have completed the setup, you can run the script from your terminal.

1.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
2.  Run the `app.py` script using the following command, replacing `<RedditUsername>` with the Reddit username you want to analyze:

<!-- end list -->

```bash
python app.py <RedditUsername>
```

### Example:

To generate a persona for the user `u/spez`, you would run:

```bash
python app.py spez
```

The script will then:

1.  Fetch the latest posts and comments for the specified user.
2.  Send the content to the OpenRouter API for analysis.
3.  Generate the persona.
4.  Save the output to a file named `spez_persona.txt` in the same directory.

The terminal will display the progress, including fetching status and API responses. If successful, you will see a confirmation message indicating that the user persona has been saved.
